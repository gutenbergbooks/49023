<h3 class='c006'><span class='xlarge'><b>I</b></span></h3>

<p class='c007'>Few events in the history of our nation have left
the imprint of greatness upon participating individuals
and groups as did the memorable Battle of
New Orleans, January 8, 1815, the culmination of
the War of 1812. Out of the great victory, there
emerged on the national scene, in the person of
Andrew Jackson, a leader destined for future greatness.
At the same time, those dissident Federalist
voices which regarded disunion as the solution to
the ills facing the young republic were quieted. With
the battle over, the abortive Hartford Convention
of December, 1814, stood in mute contrast to the
patriotic devotion to country rendered by unlearned
frontiersmen.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The question of the possession of
legal title to western lands acquired from France
by the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 was quickly settled.
Not the least result was the breaking of alliances
which had existed between the Creek Indians
and their British and Spanish allies.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is impressive that so much could be accomplished
for young America from a military engagement
which lasted little more than two hours. The
Battle of New Orleans, which occurred after the
signing of the peace treaty at Ghent in December,
has been referred to as a useless expenditure of
life and time. One must remember, however, that
the issues leading to the battle evolved over a long
period of time, many of them dating back to the
Revolution. A climax to the friction existing between
America and Great Britain was inevitable.
In this conflict, Tennessee played a prominent
role, not only as a participant in the final action of
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>the war, but in the developments preceding it. Indeed,
it is important to note that Tennessee was
influential in putting into motion the machinery
which brought about the dramatic event, from
which national attention was focused upon the
Volunteer State and her courageous sons.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='xlarge'><b>II</b></span></h3>

<p class='c007'>Felix Grundy, Nashville’s vocal and eloquent attorney,
was elected in 1811 to the United States
Congress on a platform demanding war with Great
Britain. Grundy, a native Virginian who had also
lived in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, resented the
policy of Spain and Great Britain which was to incite
the southern Indians against frontiersmen who
were inexorably pushing further to the west. Tennessee,
then in its early commercial development,
was particularly concerned over this issue because
the trade routes to New Orleans and Mobile were
under almost constant attack by well-armed red
men.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once seated in Congress, Grundy wasted no time
in pressing his attack. He aligned himself with
Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, William Lowndes,
and others who earned for themselves the title
“War Hawks” by their insistence upon war. To
them, the time was ripe for such a step since the
Napoleonic War with England was in progress, and
it offered an opportunity for America to profit from
the turmoil in Europe. Unrelentingly the “War
Hawks” pressed their cause until public opinion
forced a reluctant Congress and President James
Madison to declare war against England on June
16, 1812.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Tennesseans had watched with dismay the significant
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>success which British troops enjoyed along
the Canadian boundary, and across the northeastern
tier of states. Their concern was intensified
with the burning of Washington on August 24, 1814.
Many westerners regarded Federalist inertia toward
the war with Britain as largely responsible
for the ineffective resistance being offered. Some
Northern governors had refused to answer the War
Department’s call for militia, while others would
not assume their proportionate share of the financial
obligation.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the sack of Washington, the British vessels
and troops disappeared and left Americans wondering
where the next blow would come. James Monroe,
the tough-fisted new Secretary of State, concluded
that the abrupt thrust against Washington
and Baltimore was only a feint, designed to confuse
the government while the enemy concentrated his
forces elsewhere for a major invasion. With winter
approaching, it seemed reasonable to assume that
the strike, if made, would be in the South—probably
at some point in the Gulf region where the defenses
left much to be desired. As Monroe contemplated
the portentous days ahead, he was relieved
to know that the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief
of the Seventh Military District, comprising
the states of Tennessee, Louisiana, and the Mississippi
Territory, was Major General Andrew
Jackson of Tennessee.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Jackson had recently received national attention
by the overwhelming victory which he and his
Tennessee militiamen, led by Generals John Coffee
and William Carroll, won over the Creek Indians
at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend on March 27, 1814.
There the westerners struck a mortal blow at the
repugnant British-Indian alliance, which many believed
was responsible for the infamous massacre
of men, women, and children at Fort Mims.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>On his return from Horseshoe Bend, Jackson
was acclaimed throughout Middle Tennessee for his
victory, and was given spectacular public receptions
in Gallatin and Nashville. But his stay in
Tennessee was brief and he moved south again,
this time to Mobile, where he established headquarters
in late August, 1814.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Jackson’s use of
Mobile as his base of operations was fortunate,
for two weeks later British vessels appeared at
the entrance to Mobile Bay and made a concerted
attack on Fort Bowyer (now Fort Morgan). However,
the tiny garrison of 130 men stood fast and
when one of the British frigates ran aground, exploded,
and burned, the fleet withdrew to an unknown
area. Jackson speculated over Britain’s
future intentions.</p>

<p class='c009'>The thrust against Mobile convinced Jackson that
an invasion of major proportions somewhere along
the coast was imminent. A likely site, he thought,
would be Pensacola, which was still under Spanish
control. Spain, it will be recalled, was England’s
ally against France but was neutral toward America.
Spain’s neutrality, Jackson believed, was only
a veneer for her selfish interests which she would
direct against the United States the moment a suitable
opportunity arose. Then, too, there were the
Creeks. Jackson had broken their power at Horseshoe
Bend, but they remained in the vicinity, possibly
ready to resume hostilities if supported by a
strong belligerent. Before leaving Nashville, Jackson
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>had conferred with Governor Willie Blount
about sending a brigade of mounted Tennessee
militiamen under Brigadier General John Coffee to
join him in Mobile. Now he sent urgent word for
the militiamen to come without delay!</p>

<p class='c009'>The fraternal feeling existing between John Coffee
and Andrew Jackson ran deep. Each man, completely
devoted to the other, was willing to undergo
the most rigid personal sacrifice should the other
command it. Coffee, “tall, broad-shouldered, gentle
in manner, but brave and intelligent,” had
executed the key move that bottled up the Creeks
at Horseshoe Bend.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a> With his usual alacrity, he
once again answered his country’s call to duty and
ordered his troops to rendezvous in Fayetteville
on October 3. Patriotic feeling swept across Tennessee
as Coffee’s veterans, with the fire of battle
still flashing in their eyes, emerged from the
hills, valleys, and hamlets to make the long trek
southward for the second time within a year. Most
of them were simple countrymen, armed only with
their long rifles and knives and attired in the clothing
of the frontier. Their pantaloon pockets were
filled with bullets. In this manner they responded
to the appeal to “come forward ... as there (could
not) be a moment’s delay.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Jackson’s recall of the Tennessee militia, already
schooled in the kind of wilderness warfare
which appeared forthcoming, was a wise decision.
Against the Creeks these men had subsisted for
months in the Alabama back country with only
scanty supplies. Their mobility, loyalty, and capacity
to move upon their objective with a minimum
loss of time made Jackson confident that here was
a fighting force well prepared to meet any test.</p>

<hr class='pb c000' />

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>At Fayetteville, Coffee mustered 2,000 men into
service, and organized two divisions under Colonels
Robert H. Dyer and Thomas Williamson. At dawn
on October 5, the high-spirited troops began their
long march southward over the familiar trails
which they had traveled the previous year. During
the march, their ranks were swelled by the addition
of 800 more men, including four East Tennessee
companies. Coffee’s men reached Camp Gaines,
70 miles north of Mobile, on October 22, after
having traveled 470 miles in 18 days.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a> That autumn
trip had been accomplished with a minimum of
sickness and no deaths, and the men were inspired
with the feeling that Nature’s blessing was upon
them, however arduous the campaign might be.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the arrival of General Coffee, Jackson was
ready to move against the Spaniards at Pensacola.
He did so with an awesome display of force on
November 7, and within a few hours declared the
town in the possession of the United States. With
this blow, although it accomplished little in the
way of military success, Jackson confirmed his
“reputation as a man who could act boldly, assume
vast responsibilities, and move rapidly.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Having
quieted the aggressive intentions of the Spaniards
and Creeks, Jackson quickly returned to Mobile
where he expected a British attack at any moment.
Coffee, in the meantime, was instructed to proceed
at once to the mouth of Sandy Creek, about 20
miles north of Baton Rouge.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this point of the campaign, Jackson had no
idea that New Orleans would be the focal point of a
British invasion. He was convinced that the landing
would come somewhere to the east, and considered
that logically the invaders would align themselves
with the hostile Creeks and push through the back
country to the Mississippi River near Baton Rouge.
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>There Coffee would be in a position to repulse
whatever force was thrown against him. Unknown
to Old Hickory, however, the British had no immediate
designs upon Baton Rouge. At that moment,
a great invasion fleet of some fifty armed vessels
and over ten thousand veterans of the Napoleonic
wars were being organized at Negril Bay in Jamaica:
its objective being New Orleans.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>However uncertain Jackson’s initial operations
along the coast may have seemed to the uneasy
citizens of New Orleans, it was soon evident that
he did not intend to allow the city to go completely
undefended. To further bolster his army and make
his coastal defenses adequate, Jackson now called
upon the trusted William Carroll. Carroll was
only 26 years of age at this time but his courage
and intelligence had already elevated him to the
rank of Major General of the Second Tennessee
Division.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a> A veteran of the Creek campaign, Carroll
made no effort to conceal his destination in
his strongly worded appeal for volunteers:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='small'>Should any foreign power obtain a permanent possession
of the City of New Orleans and the mouth of the
Mississippi we may bid farwell (sic) to all our prosperity
and anticipated greatness. Let our enemy ...
place one foot in Louisiana and we are at once bestrode
by a colossus who has too long rested the
other in Canada; in fine let him command the Mississippi
River, and we become the most dependent,
degraded, and miserable people on earth.... You may
add the immortal glory of conquering the boasted
troops of a Lord Wellington.</span><a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The 3,000 militiamen who met with Carroll in
Nashville on November 13 were similar in appearance
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>to those of Coffee. One eyewitness remarked
that they were “as fine looking men as any we ever
saw, and a considerable part of them (were) well
armed, with muskets and rifles.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Another observer
noted that they “have come forward with that
promptitude which has heretofore characterized
the state.... They are generally provided with
arms, etc. at their own expense.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Six days after they gathered in Nashville, the
troops embarked on boats for New Orleans. The
main diversion offered the Tennesseans during the
slow, tedious trip down the Cumberland, Ohio and
Mississippi rivers was the daily drilling which
Carroll and his two subordinates, Brigadier Generals
Thomas Coulter and Bird Smith, gave the
recruits. There had been no time for training
prior to their hasty departure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Enroute the militiamen were cheered when they
overtook a New Orleans-bound keelboat laden with
muskets. Thomas L. Servoss, a prominent Natchez
businessman, was responsible for this fortunate
occurrence. While visiting New York during the
summer of 1814, he was informed by a government
official that New Orleans was considered the likely
site for a British invasion. Concerned for his
family’s welfare, Servoss had left for home immediately.
At Pittsburg he boarded one of two
keelboats headed for New Orleans with large quantities
of arms and ammunition. Experienced in
navigation himself and familiar with the route,
Servoss prevailed upon the captain to depart earlier
than was scheduled. By doing so, Servoss unintentionally
insured that Carroll’s troops were fully
armed before their trip was completed.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>While William Carroll and his men were plying
their way down the Mississippi, John Coffee and
his mounted militiamen were making their way
toward Sandy Creek. The 16-day march was worse
than any Coffee had ever experienced, because the
area was interlaced with streams and covered with
heavy undergrowth.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c008'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Drenching rain fell for 20
successive days. At Sandy Creek, where quantities
of corn had arrived from Tennessee, the men ate
their first adequate meal since leaving Pensacola
and the horses were foraged. Here they impatiently
awaited further word from Jackson.</p>

<p class='c009'>By now the British plan was becoming clear to
Jackson, who hastened from Mobile to New Orleans.
There, on December 2, he found the local situation
one of general turmoil and confusion. The citizens
appeared in a fighting mood and, on the whole,
received him enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jackson’s problems, however, increased immediately.
There were only about 700 regular United
States troops in the city—hardly enough to pose a
threat to an invading veteran army—and the situation
was made more difficult when the New Orleans
militia refused to serve under United States
officers. The offer of service by the Baratarian
pirates made through the local Committee of Defense
was refused by Jackson because the pirates
were at that time being prosecuted in a Federal
court. Since the pirates possessed artillery in considerable
quantities and were proficient in its use,
the Committee next turned to Federal Judge
Dominick Hall. He advised them to have the Louisiana
legislature, then meeting in New Orleans,
adopt a resolution requesting that all charges
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>against the pirates be dropped for four months.
The resolution was then presented to Judge Hall,
who, in turn, ordered the District Attorney to suspend
his prosecution for the designated period.
This action made possible the valuable contribution
of the Baratarians in the defense of New Orleans.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jackson’s problems were intensified by his own
health. He was wracked with a high fever resulting
from malaria which he contracted while in Florida.
Lacking sufficient sleep and rest, he was touchy
and sensitive to any criticism directed at him by
the legislature or local groups.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c008'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>On December 15, Jackson notified Coffee that a
large enemy fleet had been observed arriving off
Cat and Ship islands, a dozen miles off the Mississippi
Coast and 60 miles from the mouth of the
Mississippi. In his communication, Jackson thought
it unlikely that the British would attack up the
river, because the approach from its mouth was
guarded by two forts, Bourbon and St. Philip. Major
W. H. Overton, of Nashville, one of Jackson’s
capable subordinates, commanded St. Philip. Coffee
was skeptical that the invaders would try the other
logical route open to them, crossing Lake Borgne
and marching directly on the city. In the event that
the British should choose this route he promised,
“I shall be ready to meet them, in the swamps,
where one Tennessean can run down ten sailors,
and worn out Europeans, through mud, water, and
brush,—I do not believe they will ever land, but
should they attempt it, I have no doubt as to the
result, being favorable to our army.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c008'><sup>[17]</sup></a>” Events proved
that Coffee’s confidence in his men was fully justified.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jackson quickly augmented his New Orleans
garrison by ordering Coffee to make a forced
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>march of 135 miles from Baton Rouge to New Orleans,
a feat which the latter accomplished in
three days. Coffee encamped at Avart’s Plantation,
five miles upriver from the city, on December
20. Further upriver, Carroll received a similar
command to hasten his best trained and equipped
troops and additional arms to supply Coffee’s men,
whose arms and ammunition had been damaged by
the heavy rain.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c008'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>After the defeat and capture of the five little
American gunboats on Lake Borgne on December
14, the road to New Orleans was open for the invaders.
The British secretly disembarked their
troops between December 16 and 20 on Pea Island.
Then on the 22nd, they boarded open boats and
cautiously crossed Lake Borgne, about 60 miles
across. Under cover of darkness the trip was
made even more somber by the biting, penetrating
cold weather. Jackson, seemingly, lost sight of the
British army’s movements following its arrival at
Ship and Cat islands. Arriving the following morning
at Fisherman’s Village (an extreme point on
Villere’s Canal) on the Bayou Bienvenue, the invaders
with their movements still unnoticed
marched stealthily across Villere’s plantation
toward the Mississippi River. About 9 a.m., they
surprised and captured Major Gabriel Villere, and
a detachment of troops. Major Villere managed to
escape into a nearby cypress swamp, and make his
way to New Orleans where he notified Jackson at
his headquarters on Royal Street that the British
were below the city.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c008'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Faced now with a sudden crisis, Jackson was
equal to the occasion. It was noon when Jackson
learned that the Redcoats were at the Mississippi,
seven miles below New Orleans. About 2 p.m. he
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>learned from Major Arsene Lacarriere Latour,
his chief engineer, that the British numbered between
1,600 and 1,800. Jackson, meanwhile had
called in his troops from various points on the
outskirts of New Orleans. Coffee marched down
from Avart’s plantation in mid-afternoon to rendezvous
at Fort St. Charles. Carroll was sent to
the upper branch of the Bayou Bienvenue to command
Jackson’s center. The conference between
Jackson and Coffee was brief. Jackson thought of
awaiting the British attack, but acceded to Coffee’s
strategy of carrying the fight to the enemy
by a night attack. Thereupon, Coffee and his mounted
infantry proceeded southward through the city,
where one observer remembered them as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='small'>Their appearance, however, was not very military.
In their woolen hunting shirts and coperas dyed
pantaloons; with slouched hat or cap made from the
skins of raccoons or foxes; with belts of untanned
deer-skin and in which were stuck their hunting-knives—but
were admirable soldiers, remarkable for
endurance and possessing that admirable quality in
soldiers, of being able to take care of themselves. At
their head rode their gallant leader, a man of noble
respect, tall and herculean in appearance, mounted
upon a fine Tennessee thoroughbred, was stately and
impressive.</span><a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c008'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The main body of the British army, lighthearted
and confident that their movements were undetected,
bivouacked the night of the 23rd on the upper part
of Villere’s plantation. To a man they were fully
confident of an overwhelming victory. A short
distance away, however, the frontiersmen crept and
crawled into position under the brilliant moonlight
which enveloped the area. Drifting silently down
river at the same moment was the small American
schooner, the <i>Carolina</i>, which suddenly opened fire
on the British camp about 7:30 p.m. The confused
invaders were driven back three or four hundred
yards from the river’s bank by the unexpected
attack.</p>

<hr class='pb c000' />

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>The <i>Carolina’s</i> fire was the signal to attack.
Coffee, guided by Colonel Pierre Denis de la
Ronde, whose plantation was near that of Villere,
skirted the edge of a swamp to attack the enemy’s
right flank while Jackson and Carroll struck from
the front. Coffee’s powerful thrust sent the British
85th regiment reeling backward, permitting the
Tennesseans to get behind the faltering line. Then
by a “sudden movement Coffee was able to penetrate
almost to the very heart of the British
camp.”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c008'><sup>[21]</sup></a> The engagement quickly became one of
great confusion. Coffee’s riflemen were so determined
in pressing their advantage that they became
somewhat disorganized, but never lost their poise.
The invaders, on the other hand, could not regain
the initiative against the surprise attack. Much of
the battle was fought hand-to-hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>A decided advantage to the Tennesseans was
their use of long rifles against the shorter weapons
of the British. Jackson’s men kept up a brisk,
punishing fire for over two hours. Their excellent
marksmanship drew praise from Major Latour, who
noted in one spot a half dozen marks made by their
rifle balls within a diameter of only four inches.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c008'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
Little, if any, random shooting was done by the
deliberate riflemen, who had been carefully
schooled to take careful aim before firing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The battlefield confusion became more pronounced
when a heavy fog settled over the area and
soldiers of both armies were captured after being
separated from their comrades. The British gained
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>some respite from their punishment when their
Second Division arrived from Bayou Bienvenue and
slipped behind Coffee’s rear. This advantage, however,
was lost when a British commander failed to
extend his line for fear of being cut off from the
lake and boats. Finally, the Redcoats slowly retired
from the battlefield to shelter under a river
levee. By this time the fog was so heavy that pursuit
would have entailed serious hazards to the
Americans, including exposure to the <i>Carolina’s</i>
fire which had continued intermittently throughout
the fight. Accordingly, Coffee also left the field,
withdrawing about a mile and a quarter to De la
Ronde’s garden to await the dawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although the result could be regarded as indecisive,
the Americans considered the outcome a
victory since only 1,600 of their men had been pitted
against some 3,000 British. There was also a considerable
difference in the number of casualties:
American losses totaled 95 killed and wounded and
75 taken prisoner, while the British lost 400 killed
and wounded and 100 captured.</p>

<p class='c009'>The significance of the night action of December
23 was the indication that a numerically inferior
American force could hold its own against British
invaders. The Americans, many of whom lacked
formal military training, had faced British military
might and had given no quarter. They felt
strongly that they possessed the mental and physical
equipment to withstand and, indeed, to hurl
back almost any onslaught which might be thrown
against them. The only question remaining in their
minds was when their victory might come.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the other hand, the outcome of the night
struggle dismayed the British forces to the extent
that they became overly cautious, and permitted
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>Jackson valuable time in which to prepare his
New Orleans defenses.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c008'><sup>[23]</sup></a> They could, however, take
some satisfaction from the fact that they were not
dislodged from their positions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some of the Tennessee casualties included Colonels
Robert H. Dyer and John H. Gibson, who were
wounded, and the capture of Majors David Hubbard
and Charles Kavennaugh. The deaths of Colonel
James Lauderdale and Lieutenant Samuel T. Brooks
were serious losses to Coffee. Lauderdale, who had
fought with unusual courage in the Creek War and
was wounded at Horseshoe Bend, was still recovering
from his wounds when he returned to active
service with the Tennessee Mounted Volunteers.
During the engagement which took his life, Lauderdale
customarily overexposed himself in leading
his men forward. But he fought to the last with the
instinctive skill of a battle-tested soldier. Many
were the eulogies expressed for Colonel Lauderdale,
by none was more appropriate than that which
appeared in the Nashville <i>Whig</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='small'>With such examples as that of Lauderdale, which by
their splendor and their number will soon constitute
for us a national character capable of the sublimest
efforts of steady fortitude and masculine courage,
tho’ the enemy were to land a hundred thousand men
on our shores we need not tremble—they would but
serve to illustrate the invincible rigor of our free
constitution, and the irresistible energy of our spirit.</span><a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c008'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c000' />

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>There were, of course, many individual acts of
heroism performed by Tennesseans, some of
which, fortunately, have been recorded. John Donelson,
Coffee’s brother-in-law, captured an important
British officer, Major Mitchell. Lieutenant
William Trousdale, himself destined for later fame
as governor of Tennessee, was in the company
which captured a major, two lieutenants, and thirty
privates. The intrepid Trousdale barely escaped
while leading a charge against the British who
were entrenched behind a fence and a river levee.
Having already leapt upon the fence, Trousdale
glanced behind him only to discover to his dismay
that the company had been ordered to retreat,
leaving him alone in the enemy’s fire. He scrambled
down from the fence and escaped back to his
lines amid a hall of bullets.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again, as at Horseshoe Bend, the excellent
teamwork of Jackson and Coffee was evident. Coffee’s
troops bore the brunt of fire and, as disciplined
fighting men, had carried the fight to the
enemy. Their outward simplicity concealed the
marrow of the born soldier, willing—perhaps
eager—to endure any personal hardship to gain his
mission. Governor William C. C. Claiborne of
Louisiana noted this quality and wrote that the
“Tennessee troops equal the high expectations
which were formed of them; nor is it possible for
men to display more patriotism, firmness in battle,
or composure under fatigue and privations.”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c008'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
It was evident that even after the December 23
engagement, the British were still inclined to underestimate
American ability in massed battle
array. It is just as well as they reasoned from a
faulty premise and lacked the benefit of Latour’s
estimation:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='small'>General Coffee’s Tennesseans, those modest and
simple sons of nature, displayed that firm composure
which accompanies and indicates true courage....
Instinctively valiant, disciplined without having passed
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>through the formal training of reviews and garrison
maneuvers, they evinced on this memorable night, that
enthusiasm, patriotism, and a sense of a just cause,
which were of far more avail than scientific tactics.
The heroes of Wellington, who boasted of their military
tactics and disciplined valor, were often doomed by
woful (sic) experience, to appreciate the prowess of
those warlike sons of the western country.</span><a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c008'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='xlarge'><b>V</b></span></h3>

<p class='c007'>Both armies now began in earnest to prepare
for the impending big battle. The British ferried in
several thousand more soldiers, bringing their
number to approximately 8,000. General Sir Edward
M. Pakenham, the Duke of Wellington’s
brother-in-law, arrived on Christmas Day eager to
add other laurels to his 22-year military career.
His accomplishments already included his decisive
attack as division commander at Salamanca in the
Peninsula Campaign against Napoleon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jackson, although elated over the results of the
initial encounter, realized that the British had
come to fight, not as a striking force similar to
that of the Washington foray, but as a conquering
army bent upon seizing the Mississippi Valley.
When, early in the morning of December 24, there
was no move by the invaders, Jackson drew his
army back about two miles to a point between the
McCarty and Chalmette plantations and formed a
line which extended from the Mississippi River on
his right to a cypress swamp on the left.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c008'><sup>[27]</sup></a> The Rodriguez
Canal, a large wet ditch five feet deep, ran
in front of the works. There the soldiers worked
feverishly day and night to erect strong breastworks.
Carroll’s position was on an extension of
the canal. Coffee, on the extreme left of Jackson’s
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>line after a scare on December 28, extended his
ditch and works into the swamp, eliminating almost
any further possibility for a flanking attack. The
entire line covered about three-quarters of a mile,
with about two-thirds of this being across the open
plain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although no general action ensued immediately
after the night battle, conditions in the battlefield
area were hardly tranquil prior to January 8. On
the evening of December 27, the British rushed a
strong force forward, causing Jackson’s advance
guard to fall back under heavy cannon, rocket, and
musket fire. Pakenham staged a reconnaissance in
force the next day and before it was called off the
British were able to install a sizable force behind
a fence oblique to the American line. Carroll instructed
Colonel James Henderson and a detachment
of 200 men to sweep along a wooded area,
make a turn to the right toward the river and thus
cut off the Redcoats. Unfortunately, Henderson’s
slant to the right was premature and left the British
still well covered by the fence, and his detachment
several yards away from the protective covering
of the woods.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c008'><sup>[28]</sup></a> A burst of musketry killed Henderson
and five men and the others fell back into the
woods. In the noisy and heavy artillery duel of
January 1, casualties on each side were few, but
the Americans at the guns proved as keen marksmen
as the Tennessee riflemen, and impressed
the British considerably.</p>

<p class='c009'>The British sentries were indeed terrified by the
Tennesseans’ ability with their rifles. These sentries
called the Tennesseans <i>dirty shirts</i> because
their brown hunting dress camouflaged them in the
thick undergrowth and dry grass. These militiamen
were not soldiers in the European definition
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>of the word. Many were frontiersmen who had
battled the wilderness and endured the merciless
elements of nature. Small wonder it is that they
were not awed by the polished legions poised for
their defeat. In truth, their pride grew as they
measured themselves against the reputation of their
heralded foe.</p>

<p class='c009'>They gained considerable satisfaction, for example,
from their harassment of the enemy. One
operation which they called the “hunting party”
amounted to nothing more than slipping out at night
and disposing of as many British sentries as
possible. In one night’s effort, one old Tennessean
killed three sentries, took their arms and
accouterments, and returned before dawn boasting
of his feat.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Jackson was finally in position, his force
of some 5,000 presented a heterogeneous array of
the unlikeliest components for an army. The blue-coated
American regulars anchored one end of the
line and Coffee’s militiamen the other. In between
were various groups such as the Louisiana militia;
New Orleans volunteers; Mississippians; battalion
of free men of color; Louisiana Creoles; and the
recently arrived Kentuckians. The Baratarian pirates
had their cannons, ranging in size from 6- to
32-pounders, loaded and ready to fire on signal.
The breastworks were five feet high, and were
considered by Jackson to be impenetrable by small
projectiles. Pakenham apparently did not share
this view. His plan of attack was now devised, and
before the misty morning of January 8 was gone,
the Americans and British engaged each other in
their last great struggle.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
<h3 class='c006'><span class='xlarge'><b>VI</b></span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>General Pakenham, realizing that further delays
would only give Jackson additional time in which to
make his position more secure, concluded that a
day-break frontal attack would break the resistance
of the Americans. He was still not convinced of
their ultimate ability to withstand Britannia’s veterans.
Strangely, he was joined in this opinion by
his supporting officers, although they had witnessed
the bravery and skill of the American in arms in
both night and day engagements.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sitting in the top of a tree, surveying the American
works on the afternoon of January 7, Pakenham
was inclined to agree with a deserter to his
ranks that the weakest point in the American position
was the extreme left, where some of Coffee’s
militiamen stood knee-deep in the swamp. So far
as he could determine, the outlook appeared good
that the morning would bring a memorable victory.
His plan called for three columns to attack. The
smaller one, numbering about 800 men, was to
invest the American right. Two thousand soldiers
were in the middle column, while the 4,000 on the
British right were to storm Coffee’s militiamen
and attack Jackson’s rear. To begin the attack,
1,400 troops would be transported across the Mississippi
by boats brought in from Lake Borgne to
capture an American battery erected there to rake
the British ranks.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jackson also was observing Pakenham on the
afternoon of the seventh and he concluded that a
major assault upon his works was imminent. Fascines
and scaling ladders were in evidence, as
were additional troops which had arrived the previous
day under the command of Major General
John Lambert, who had sailed from England at the
end of October. Jackson’s plan of defense, a simple
one, was designed to frustrate and repulse the
British onslaught. The riflemen were numbered
“one” and “two.” At the signal, the “ones” would
fire first, step back, reload, and then wait for the
“twos” to fire.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>The night hours wore slowly on until the first
vestiges of morning light which was hardly perceptible
because of the low-hanging fog. Every
Tennessean fingered his trigger, checking occasionally
to see if his trusty long knife was in place
should hand-to-hand struggle become necessary.
Finally, when the rolling mists parted, there was
seen a red line advancing across the plain of Chalmette
toward the American entrenchments. When
Jackson saw this, he felt that the plan of attack
would fail because no frontal attack could storm
his entrenchments. Coffee strode up and down his
line encouraging his men to remain steady and to
withhold their fire until “one could see their belt-buckles.”<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c008'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
On and on the silent line flowed, until it
seemed like a great red carpet across the battlefield.
Coffee recalled seeing the provocative scene
of Redcoats advancing “in solid column in superior
numbers and great order.” Within a few moments
a mighty blast of artillery mowed down entire
columns, but failed to halt the now surging tide
streaming dangerously near the entrenchments. The
British had come to within forty yards of Coffee’s
flank before he roared: “Now men, aim for the
center of the cross belts——fire!”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c008'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The smoke from the long rifles hung so heavy in
that misty morning that Jackson, slightly to the
right of center, could not ascertain the result of
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>the militiamen’s blast. So with Abner Duncan and
Tom Overton he rode to Coffee’s end of the line. A
few moments later there was another sharp, ringing
volley, and Jackson increased his horse’s gallop.
When he was within 100 yards of Coffee, the
smoke lifted just enough for the surprised commander
to see the British “falling back in a confused
mass with the first ranks of their column ...
blown away.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c008'><sup>[31]</sup></a> So far as Coffee was concerned,
the grape and canister were “nothing to the carnage
of our rifles and muskets when they (the
British) reached them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>General Carroll also caught the force of the
attack when nearly 2,000 men bore down upon the
center of his line. As before, his rifles answered
with an authority which inspired one officer to
write: “The determined firmness of the men, silent
as death at their posts, convinced me that on that
day they would add fresh laurels to those already
won by Tennessee.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c008'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Regrouping, the British line advanced a second
time only to be cut down again. It was now apparent
that Pakenham’s well devised plans had gone awry.
The depleted columns which did reach the works
could not scale them because an Irish regiment and
a West Indian regiment, entrusted with the responsibility
of carrying the fascines and scaling ladders,
had failed in their duty. A major, a lieutenant, and
twenty men finally pressed across the ditch on the
American left, and the two officers started up the
works. The major was riddled immediately with
bullets, but the lieutenant managed to scale the
top and demanded the surrender of a couple of
militia officers facing him. To this demand they
suggested that he look behind him, which he did
and discovered to his consternation that the men
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>whom he thought were following him “had vanished
as if the earth had opened and swallowed them up.”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c008'><sup>[33]</sup></a>
Of greater consequence to the British, however,
was the death of General Pakenham, who had been
cut down as he attempted to arouse his stricken
troops for another assault.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the struggle, several Tennesseans became
mixed with the Kentuckians and one of them was
accidentally killed by a Kentucky sharpshooter when
a gun discharged prematurely. One Tennessean,
remembered only as Paleface, remained with the
Kentuckians throughout the battle. A gaunt little
man, Paleface received the sword of a surrendering
British officer and, in the closing minutes of
the fight, killed at nearly 300 yards a retreating
Redcoat who was making obscene gestures at the
defenders.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the firing died down, captives began to
trickle into the works, one of whom was a young
man about 19 or 20 years old, apparently in great
pain. He was assisted by several Kentuckians who
sought to alleviate his suffering by removing his
accouterments. At the same time a Tennessean
returned from the river with a tin coffee pot filled
with water. The stricken soldier asked if he could
have just a drop. “Oh yes!” said the Tennessean,
“I will treat you to anything I’ve got.” After taking
two or three sips out of the spout, the young man
returned the pot, sank backward, took a gasp or
two, and died.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c008'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>By now, the tide of battle was receding as the
aggressors retired from the field “under cover of
a very thick fog.”<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c008'><sup>[35]</sup></a> When the smoke and fog lifted,
the gallant defenders witnessed a sight which
would forever be etched upon their minds. Before
them were the tortured forms of the dead and dying,
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>many of them convulsing in the agonies of
death. Across the battlefield, there also arose
sounds which would reverberate across the years
in their memories—the groans and lamentations
of fallen men. Witnessing that scene, few could
dispute Coffee’s conviction that the “famous campaign
against Orleans is at rest at present, and has
thus far been marked with better fortune to the
American arms than anything heretofore known.”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c008'><sup>[36]</sup></a>
Over 2,000 British were either dead, wounded, or
missing, while the American loss stood at seven
killed and six wounded.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c008'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Thus, within two hours the Battle of New Orleans
belonged to history. General Lambert, the
only remaining British officer of general rank,
covered the retreat and that afternoon assumed the
melancholy task of retrieving and burying the dead.
The bodies were delivered to the British lines by
the Tennesseans and Kentuckians on the unused
scaling ladders they found strewn across the battlefield.
The dead soldiers were interred in a site
on the Bienvenu plantation. Ironically, some British
officers were buried in Villere’s garden, which
had been their headquarters prior to the battle.
It was not until the night of January 18, however,
that the entire British army withdrew from its
encampments and returned across Lake Borgne to
their fleet still anchored in deep water between
Cat and Ship islands. Their departure was carefully
observed by Jackson, who distributed his
forces to protect every approach to the city should
the frustrated enemy attempt to strike another
blow.</p>

<p class='c007'>On January 21, 1815, Tennessee was “revered,
and General Jackson idolized” by appreciative
citizens of New Orleans who filled the city’s streets
to cheer the army during its victory march through
the city. Included in the festive occasion, arranged
as an outpouring of the city’s gratitude, was a
“triumphal arch, adorned with wreaths, supported
by eighteen pillars (one for each state) and eighteen
damsels, the fairest in the city, bearing a motto
emblematic of the state she represented.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c008'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Flowers
were scattered in abundance along the entire route.
While the period of rejoicing was still in progress,
Mrs. Jackson arrived in the city on February 19th
in time for a grand ball given in the general’s
honor on Washington’s birthday.</p>

<p class='c009'>Praise was showered upon the Tennesseans,
particularly the Coffee militiamen who, from the
inception of the campaign, had carried the heaviest
burden of battle among the American troops. From
the time they departed Fayetteville in early October,
they had been almost constantly in the saddle
or on foot, often wading through muck, and stoically
enduring privation. This patient endurance of
any test they were called upon to face, drew from
Robert Butler, Adjutant General, Seventh Military
District, this comment:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='small'>To the Tennessee mounted gunmen, to their gallant
leader, brigadier-general Coffee, the general presents
his warmest thanks, not only for their uniform good
conduct in action, but for the wonderful patience with
which they have borne the fatigue, and the perseverance
with which they surmounted the difficulties of
a most painful march, in order to meet the enemy—a
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>diligence and zeal to which we probably owe the
salvation of the country. Ordinary activity would have
brought them too late to act the brilliant part they
have performed in the defeat of our invaders.</span><a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c008'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Resolutions of thanks and gratitude were also
tendered the Tennesseans by the Louisiana Legislature
which, however, failed to include any recognition
of Jackson. In a note to that body, Coffee
courteously thanked them for the recognition, but
added that the highest honors given to anyone
connected with the defense of New Orleans rightfully
belonged to General Jackson.</p>

<p class='c009'>On March 14, word finally reached Jackson that
the war was officially over. He thereupon released
the Tennesseans from duty and instructed Generals
Coffee and Carroll to return them home immediately.
Traveling over the famed Natchez Trace,
there was ample time for them to reflect upon the
momentous events of the past five months, and
they may have wondered what the result at New
Orleans would have been had Tennessee not been
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>represented there. But there was one thing certain!
No group connected with New Orleans marched
any harder, fought more relentlessly, or endured
hardship as long as did the Tennesseans. This
being the case, one could not blame them for musing
a bit, and occasionally stroking their long
rifles, which had etched for each of them an honored
place in the golden annals of their country’s
history.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>It is a long trail leading from the plain of Chalmette
to January 8, 1965, but nothing that has
happened over these years lessens the modern
Tennessean’s appreciation for the warriors who
represented their state so well at New Orleans.
History has observed that of the approximately
5,000 Tennesseans in the vicinity almost 1,500 were
on the line during the battle.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the exception of the 700 United States regulars,
no group connected with the campaign on
the American side had the military training and
leadership which the Tennesseans already possessed
by virtue of their participation in the
Creek War. If the British attack on the American
left, held by Coffee’s Tennesseans, had succeeded,
the battle’s outcome might well have been a different
story.</p>

<p class='c009'>The several groups comprising Jackson’s army
performed capably. Each had its unique talents and
accomplished much of what was expected of it.
When considering the entire New Orleans campaign,
however, one is immediately impressed
with the fact that no phase can be studied without
finding evidence of Tennessee’s participation. It
is clear in retrospect, as it was in 1815, that the
role of Tennessee at New Orleans was highly significant,
perhaps the dominant force, in bringing
the campaign to a successful conclusion.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>Letter from Major-General Jackson <br /> to the Secretary of War.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Camp, four miles below Orleans, 9th January, 1815.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir:</p>

<p class='c009'>During the days of the 6th and 7th, the enemy had
been actively employed in making preparations for
an attack on my lines. With infinite labour they
had succeeded on the night of the 7th in getting
their boats across from the lake to the river, by
widening and deepening the canal on which they
had effected their disembarkation. It had not been
in my power to impede these operations by a
general attack—added to other reasons, the nature
of the troops under my command, mostly militia,
rendered it too hazardous to attempt extensive
offensive movements in an open country, against a
numerous and well-disciplined army. Although my
forces, as to number, had been increased by the
arrival of the Kentucky division, my strength had
received very little addition; a small portion only
of that detachment being provided with arms. Compelled
thus to wait the attack of the enemy, I took
every measure to repel it when it should be made,
and to defeat the object he had in view. General
Morgan with the Orleans contingent, the Louisiana
militia, and a strong detachment of the Kentucky
troops, occupied an intrenched camp on the opposite
side of the river, protected by strong batteries on
the bank, erected and superintended by commodore
Patterson.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>In my encampment every thing was ready for
action, when early on the morning of the 8th the
enemy, after throwing a heavy shower of bombs
and congreve rockets, advanced their columns on
my right and left, to storm my intrenchments. I
cannot speak sufficiently in praise of the firmness
and deliberation with which my whole line received
their approach. More could not have been expected
from veterans inured to war.—For an hour the
fire of the small arms was as incessant and severe
as can be imagined. The artillery, too, directed
by officers who displayed equal skill and courage,
did great execution. Yet the columns of the enemy
continued to advance with a firmness which reflects
upon them the greatest credit. Twice the
column which approached me on my left, was repulsed
by the troops of general Carroll, those of
general Coffee and a division of the Kentucky
militia, and twice they formed again and renewed
the assault. At length, however, cut to pieces,
they fled in confusion from the field, leaving it
covered with their dead and wounded. The loss
which the enemy sustained on this occasion, cannot
be estimated at less than fifteen hundred in killed,
wounded, and prisoners. Upwards of three hundred
have already been delivered over for burial; and
my men are still engaged in picking them up within
my lines, and carrying them to the point where
the enemy are to receive them. This is in addition
to the dead and wounded whom the enemy have
been enabled to carry from the field during and
since the action, and to those who have since died
of the wounds they received. We have taken about
five hundred prisoners, upwards of three hundred
of whom are wounded, and a great part of them
mortally. My loss has not exceeded, and I believe
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>has not amounted to ten killed and as many wounded.
The entire destruction of the enemy’s army
was now inevitable, had it not been for an unfortunate
occurrence, which at this moment took place on the
other side of the river. Simultaneously with his
advance upon my lines, he had thrown over in his
boats a considerable force to the other side of the
river. These having landed, were hardy enough to
advance against the works of general Morgan; and,
what is strange and difficult to account for, at the
very moment when their entire discomfiture was
looked for with a confidence approaching to certainty,
the Kentucky re-enforcements, in whom so
much reliance had been placed, ingloriously fled,
drawing after them, by their example, the remainder
of the forces; and thus yielding to the enemy that
most formidable position. The batteries which had
rendered me, for many days, the most important
service, though bravely defended, were, of course,
now abandoned; not however until the guns had
been spiked.</p>

<p class='c009'>This unfortunate rout had totally changed the
aspect of affairs. The enemy now occupied a position
from which they might annoy us without hazard,
and by means of which they might have been able
to defeat, in a great measure, the effects of our
success on this side the river. It became therefore
an object of the first consequence to dislodge him
as soon as possible. For this object, all the means
in my power, which I could with any safety use,
were immediately put in preparation. Perhaps,
however, it was owing somewhat to another cause
that I succeeded even beyond my expectations. In
negotiating the terms of a temporary suspension
of hostilities, to enable the enemy to bury their
dead and provide for their wounded, I had required
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>certain propositions to be acceded to as a basis,
among which this was one—that, although hostilities
should cease on this side the river until
twelve o’clock of this day, yet it was not to be
understood that they should cease on the other
side; but that no re-enforcements should be sent
across by either army until the expiration of that
day. His excellency major-general Lambert begged
time to consider of those propositions until ten
o’clock of to-day, and in the meantime re-crossed
his troops. I need not tell you with how much
eagerness I immediately regained possession of the
position he had thus happily quitted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The enemy having concentrated his forces, may
again attempt to drive me from my position by
storm. Whenever he does, I have no doubt my
men will act with their usual firmness, and sustain
a character now become dear to them.</p>

<div class='c014'>I have the honour to be, &amp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div class='c014'>ANDREW JACKSON.</div>

<hr class='c015' />

<h3 class='c006'>Letter from Major-General Jackson <br /> to the Secretary of War.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Camp, four miles below Orleans, January 13, 1815.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir:</p>

<p class='c009'>At such a crisis I conceive it my duty to keep
you constantly advised of my situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 10th instant I forwarded you an account
of the bold attempt made by the enemy on the
morning of the 8th, to take possession of my works
by storm, and of the severe repulse which he met
with. That report having been sent by the mail
which crosses the lake, may possibly have
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>miscarried; for which reason I think it the more
necessary briefly to repeat the substance of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early on the morning of the 8th, the enemy having
been actively employed the two preceding days
in making preparations for a storm, advanced in
two strong columns on my right and left. They were
received however, with a firmness which it seems
they little expected, and which defeated all their
hopes. My men, undisturbed by their approach,
which indeed they had long anxiously wished for,
opened upon them a fire so deliberate and certain,
as rendered their scaling ladders and fascines, as
their more direct implements of warfare, perfectly
useless. For upwards of an hour it was continued
with a briskness of which there has been but
few instances, perhaps, in any country. In justice
to the enemy it must be said, they withstood it
as long as could have been expected from the most
determined bravery. At length, however, when all
prospects of success became hopeless, they fled
in confusion from the field—leaving it covered
with their dead and wounded. Their loss was immense.
I had first computed it at fifteen hundred; it
is since ascertained to have been much greater.
Upon information which is believed to be correct,
colonel Hayne, the inspector-general, reports it to
be in the total two thousand six hundred. His
report I enclose you. My loss was inconsiderable
being only seven killed and six wounded. Such a
disproportion in loss, when we consider the number
and the kind of troops engaged, must, I know, excite
astonishment, and may not every where, be fully
credited; yet I am perfectly satisfied that the account
is not exaggerated on the one part, nor
underrated on the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>The enemy having hastily quitted a post which
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>they had gained possession of on the other side
of the river, and we having immediately returned to
it, both armies at present occupy their former
positions. Whether, after the severe loss he has
sustained, he is preparing to return to his shipping
or to make still mightier efforts to attain his first
object, I do not pretend to determine—it becomes
me to act as though the latter were his intention.
One thing, however, seems certain, that if he still
calculates on effecting what he has hitherto been
unable to accomplish, he must expect considerable
re-enforcements; as the force with which he landed
must undoubtedly be diminished by at least
three thousand. Besides the loss which he sustained
on the night of the 23d ult. which is estimated at
four hundred, he cannot have suffered less between
that period and the morning of the 8th
inst. than three hundred—having, within that time,
been repulsed in two general attempts to drive us
from our position, and there having been continual
cannonading and skirmishing during the whole of it.
Yet he is still able to show a very formidable
force.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is little doubt that the commanding general,
sir Edward Packenham, was killed in the action
of the 8th, and that major-generals Kean and Gibbs
were badly wounded.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whenever a more leisure moment shall occur,
I will take the liberty to make out and forward
you a more circumstantial account of the several
actions, and particularly that of the 8th; in doing
which my chief motive will be to render justice
to those brave men I have the honour to command,
and who have so remarkably distinguished themselves.
I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>
